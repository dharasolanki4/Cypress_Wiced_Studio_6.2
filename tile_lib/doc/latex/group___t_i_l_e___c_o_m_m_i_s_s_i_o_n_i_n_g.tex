Commissioning a Tile Node is the process of assigning it a \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair. There are 2 ways to commission a Tile Node\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item At Manufacturing\+: here the \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair is burnt during Manufacturing of the Tile Node.
\item Over The Air\+: here the \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair is generated during activation of the Tile Node.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Manufacturing Commissioning}

Tile provides a list of \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pairs which are unique for each Tile Node. The pair is burnt into the Tile Node persistent memory during manufacturing.

\subsection*{O\+TA Commissioning}

This feature is needed for Tile Nodes that don\textquotesingle{}t support burning of a \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair during manufacturing. For instance, it can be used when Tile functionnality is added to a product through an O\+TA FW upgrade. It adds no vulnerability to activated Tiles and provides very decent protection against fake Tile Nodes by using a Model Specific Interim \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair.

\subsubsection*{Interim Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key Pair}

These are assigned by Tile and are specific to a Model Number.

\subsubsection*{Commissioning Process}

For Tile Nodes supporting O\+T\+A\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+M\+I\+S\+S\+I\+O\+N\+I\+NG, the \mbox{[}Tile\+ID, Tile\+Auth\+Key\mbox{]} pair is assigned during activation. Here is the M\+SC\+:
